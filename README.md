This is the second year of NIPAA workshop colocated with [IEEE-ICNP](https://icnp21.cs.ucr.edu/). Last year led to exiting talks that can be found [here](https://icnp20.cs.ucr.edu/nipaa.html).

#### Program
| Program      | Pacific Time    | CET    | Beijing Time  |  
| ---------- | :-----------:  | :-----------: | :-----------: |
| Opening     | 06:00     | 15:00    | 22:00|
| Keynote: How We Change the Internet? <br> Speaker: Prof. Michael Schapira. Michael Schapira is a professor of Computer Science at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. His research interests lie in the design and analysis of Internet protocols and architectures and, in particular, in the interface of machine learning and networking. Prior to joining Hebrew U, Michael has held research positions at UC Berkeley, Yale, Princeton, and Google (NYC). He is the recipient of an ERC Starting Grant, the IETF/IRTF Applied Networking Research Prize, the Wolf Foundation's Krill Prize, faculty research awards from Microsoft, Google, and Facebook, and the IEEE Communications Society William R. Bennett Prize. <br> Abstract: Since its inception in the 1980s, the Internet has served us remarkably well, scaling to support ever more demanding services and ever increasing traffic volumes and user populations. However, in the course of the decades following the Interent's birth, it has become clear that the Internet suffers from inherent security-related and performance-related flaws, rendering it vulnerable to devastating attacks and limiting its ability to support the services of tomorrow.
The key challenge facing those who wish to address this predicament is the difficulty of introducing changes to the long-ossified Internet infrastructure, which is due to technical reasons (e.g., backwards compatibility, incremental deployability), safety-related reasons (coexistence with legacy protocols), and economic reasons (incentives for adopters). In this talk, I will discuss and exemplify strategies for contending with the stagnation of the Internet. In particular, I will present recent attempts for improving the Internet within today's architectural framework, as well as (more valiant) attempts to revisit the Internet architecture itself.  | 06:05     | 15:05    | 22:05|

#### Rationale for the Workshop

With the ongoing pandemic, the ICT infrastructure is changing from an optional tool to a necessity for many people. With large numbers of individuals now relying on the Internet to work from home, daily life, online education and entertainment, the significance of the Internet has unprecedentedly surged. As with the increasingly dependence of the Internet application, e.g., Augmented reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) for entertainment, or video and audio streaming for working and education, the requirement on the Internet security, quality, and resilience increases continually.

In order to make 5G and even _B5G (Beyond 5G)_ a large scale success, fixed networks in fronthaul, middlehaul and backhaul will have to play a crucial role. More needs to be done in the ‘fixed’ (non-wireless) network to fully take advantage of these developments.

_To automate and ensure efficiency of industry operations_, an extremely reliant, intelligent and lean network is required. With regard to lean networking a well-known problem in IIoT is to devise an addressing scheme that would work for an entire spectrum of connected endpoints be it humans, servers or machines such as sensors, robots, virtual PLCs, digital twins, etc. The approach of integrating devices within the Internet address structure does not full satisfy energy and bits on wire efficiency – often the header overhead is higher than the payload.

On the other hand, _the evolution of media from Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) to holograms_ is already taking place as a natural progression in this space. The current network infrastructures just barely meet the demands of high bandwidth and low latency AR/VR. But networked-holograms require a paradigm shift in media formats and communication methodologies. The research on holographic media displays is going strong.  The question then is, how can network technologies prepare for such type of high volume, low-latency media? Their far-reaching influence is not just anticipated in the entertainment and gaming industry but will inspire the next generation of interactions and visualization technologies in the fields of personal & social communications, education, design, medicine, etc.

Lastly, _the Internet infrastructure continues to evolve_ as applications and data become more localized and concentrated at the edges, yet a part of them is distributed in the cloud. Considerations will be required to describe protocols and on-the-wire data formats that are location, cost, and service-aware but are also security conscious. The current mechanisms do not support these requirements. There is a need to collectively evolve the existing technologies to lay the foundation for networks that support 5G and beyond 5G services and scenarios that are adaptable and deployable at large scale – such an initiative is simply called New IP – the New Internet Protocol.

#### Call for Papers

We invite novel ideas simulating a discussion on algorithms, architectures, and protocols that are relevant in the 5G and Beyond 5G era and will help in defining New IP - the innovations in network layer for the future. New IP aims to look at a set of problems from the key aspects mentioned above: new services, new media and new infrastructures, as a unifying effort.
